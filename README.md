# API Call-Based Windows Malware Classifier #

This project implements a two-stage classifier to determine if a given program exhibits malicious behaviour based on the API calls that it makes. Through the use of hyperparameter tuning and other optimisation techniques, the performance of the models are improved and saved for future deployment and use.
